<h1>Andrew Robinson</h1>

<h2><a href="/">/now</a>: <a href="http://ar3.me/now">ar3.me/now</a></h2>

<h2>Location:</h2>
<p>
Indianapolis

United States
</p>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
Entrepreneurship-minded, inbound-marketing loving, “leadership = servitude” thinking, agile evangelizing, Venture Technologist, Technical Product Manager and Full-Lifecycle Software Engineer and Executive, looking to make a dent in the universe.
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I love to identify problems, turn them into opportunities, and then inspire a solution to be built with a focus on iteration and the build->measure->learn feedback loop. In every problem, there is potential...I try to inspire potential fulfillment.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I want to make a dent in universe. I want to leave this world better than I found it. I want to get to know people, because for the most part people are amazing, and have amazing stories. Finally, I want to be proof that doing good, inspires others to do good and understanding, uplifting, empowering, and overall loving people is the key to true success.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
Quote from the series Cosmos: "Nobody knows how life got started. Most of the evidence from that time was destroyed by impact and erosion. Science works on the frontier of knowledge and ignorance. We’re not afraid to admit what we don’t know. There’s no shame in that. The only shame is to pretend that we have all the answers. Maybe someone watching this, will be the first to solve the mystery of how life on Earth began."
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
My epiphany is that we should all have the courage be vulnerable enough to live on the edge of knowledge and ignorance and even with this vulnerability, continue to move forward...in all of our endeavors.

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I make connections - with old texts, with new words, with the body, with an audience, with ideas
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
Art is at the heart of the seemingly diverse things I do. It begins with my theatre practice and radiates outward. I do Feldenkrais because it made a difference in my art and now I can help with other people's art as well. I help people teach/understand/experience Shakespeare because his work is not only some of the most extraordinary theatre ever created but because his work influences so much other art and culture.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
I just realized that a lot of my seemingly different identities intersected around the idea of Not Knowing. What started as a blog post about people's discomfort with not understanding every word of Shakespeare led to an understanding something about what Art can be for.  (i.e. help us deal with ambiguity, mystery, not having answers) and how the humanities prepare us for that too. Then I realized I'd already written a post on Feldenkrais and the value of saying "I don't know."
